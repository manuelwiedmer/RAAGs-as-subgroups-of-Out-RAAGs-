    "The following code contains some functions that can be used to do computations involving the outer automorphism groups of right-angled groups. In particular, they can be used to find examples of right-angled Artin groups as subgroups of the outer automorphism groups of a right-angled Artin group. Among other things, one can construct for any given right-angled Artin group A_Lambda with at least three vertices a graph Gamma such that A_Lambda is a finite-index subgroup of Out(A_Gamma). Part of this code is based on the code from Benjamin Brück used for [A note on virtual duality and automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/glasgow-mathematical-journal/article/note-on-virtual-duality-and-automorphism-groups-of-rightangled-artin-groups/361EEE6AD7E12AC5F7D87DE26CFFBF13), which can be found on https://github.com/benjaminbrueck/computations_for_roars. In particular, the following functions (in the file \"functions.py\") were taken from that code: ```star```, ```conn_comps```, ```is_Sil```, ```supp_graph``` and ```theta```, where the last function was slightly adapted.\n",
    "\n",
